# stylistic-word-clouds
Python scripts for creating stylistic word clouds.

Has dependencies on `numpy`, `Pillow`, and `matplotlib`.

Also makes use of a few libraries:

* [Python word_cloud package](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) by Andreas Mueller
* [Icon Font to PNG](https://github.com/Pythonity/icon-font-to-png) by Pythonity 
* [paletteable Python library](https://github.com/jiffyclub/palettable) 

The scripts assume that the all-icons-export was used with [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) by Dave Gandy.
